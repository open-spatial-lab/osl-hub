            Your email is necessary to save bookmarked pages and collections, if
            you choose to do so. We store your email address and login provider
            (e.g. Google, Facebook) to allow you to log in to the site. We do
            not store your password. We do not share your data with any third
            parties.

            We use Insights analytics to better understand which pages interest
            you most. These analytics are not shared with any other third
            parties, and comply with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR privacy regulations.
            Insight doesn't require any cookies, and instead we recommend this <a
